## üîπ Features Implemented

### **1. Data Cleaning**
- Checking for missing or null values.
- Validating column integrity.
- Ensuring proper data types.

```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE transactions_id IS NULL 
OR sale_date IS NULL 
OR sale_time IS NULL
OR gender IS NULL 
OR age IS NULL 
OR category IS NULL 
OR quantity IS NULL 
OR cogs IS NULL 
OR total_sale IS NULL;
```

---

### **2. Data Exploration**
- Total number of sales.
- Unique customers count.
- Unique product categories.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sales FROM retail_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;
```

---

### **3. Business Analysis Queries**
Includes various queries like:
- Sales by date, category, and customer.
